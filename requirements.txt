# Python requirements for MCP Code Execution examples
# Python 3.8+ required

# For async file operations (optional, examples use sync for simplicity)
# aiofiles>=23.0.0

# Type checking support
typing-extensions>=4.0.0

# Note: In a real implementation, you would also need:
# - mcp (Model Context Protocol SDK)
# - Additional dependencies for specific MCP servers
# - pandas (for data analysis examples)
# - Any other libraries your specific use case requires
