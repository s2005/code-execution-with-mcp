# Example 06: Reusable Skills

## Description
Demonstrates how agents can save commonly used operations as reusable functions, building a library of tested skills.

## Key Benefits
- Code reuse across multiple workflows
- Independent testing and validation
- Faster development of complex agents
- Better maintainability
- Skills can be composed together for more complex tasks

## Execution Output

```
Example 6: Reusable Skills
============================================================

Using reusable skill: save_sheet_as_csv

Converting Google Sheet 'abc123' to CSV...
✓ Sheet saved to: ./workspace/sheet-abc123.csv

File size: 180 bytes

File preview:
  Order ID,Status,Amount,Customer
  1001,pending,150.0,Acme Corp
  1002,completed,200.0,TechCo
  1003,pending,175.5,StartupXYZ

Key insight: Reusable skills enable:
  - Code reuse across multiple workflows
  - Independent testing and validation
  - Faster development of complex agents
  - Better maintainability

Agents can build up a library of skills over time,
making them more capable with each new skill learned.
